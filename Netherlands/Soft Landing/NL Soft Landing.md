Here are some commonly overlooked — but highly valuable — things to do during your **soft landing trip** that aren't yet on your schedule:

---

### ✅ **Important but Easy-to-Miss Tasks**

#### 🏠 **Home Setup & Comfort**

- **Measure key areas** at Mahlerstraat 23 (window sizes, room dimensions, closet widths) for:
    
    - Curtains, rugs, washer/dryer, and future furniture planning
        
- **Test all keys & locks** (main door, shed, mailbox)
    
- **Photograph appliance labels & serial numbers** for future repairs or manuals
    

#### 📦 **Local Services & Registration**

- **Locate your neighborhood’s huisarts (GP)** and apotheek (pharmacy)
    
    - Even if you won’t register now, know where to go when you return with family
        
- **Walk to your wijkbureau** (neighborhood office) or **post office** (PostNL point)
    
- **Get your street’s trash/recycling pickup rules** (bin color/rotation can vary)
    
    - Double-check glass collection points (they're not at every residence)
        

#### 🛡️ **Insurance & Accounts**

- **Get a quote for contents insurance (inboedelverzekering)** — usually bundled with opstal
    
- **Open a Dutch store loyalty account** (Albert Heijn Bonuskaart, Praxis Club, etc.)
    
    - Useful for weekly savings without requiring residency
        

#### 📶 **Connectivity Check**

- **Test signal strength inside Mahlerstraat 23** with your SIM card (especially if using Vodafone or Lebara)
    
- **Identify your main Wi-Fi modem location + power outlets** for future desk/office setup
    

#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Social & Support**

- **Introduce yourself to one neighbor**
    
    - Helpful when deliveries arrive after your return to the U.S.
        
- **Ask Kevin if he recommends a local handyman** or delivery assembler
    

#### 🧾 **Paperwork & Redundancy**

- **Leave a printed copy of your deed + keys inventory in the house** (protected spot)
    
- **Photograph your entire fuse box**, boiler controls, and thermostat instructions
    
- **Create a WhatsApp group** with Amelia, Kevin, and (if willing) a neighbor or two
