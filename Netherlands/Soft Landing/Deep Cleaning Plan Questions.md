Still-open details I need before drafting your room-by-room pre-move-in deep-clean checklist

If you don’t know an answer, just say so or leave it blank; I can design the plan to cover all possibilities.

1. Current cleanliness & occupancy

Will the house be completely empty when you get access (including fridge, wardrobes, garden shed)?
RESPONSE: Home has some furniture in it. 
	Ground floor:
		Kitchen: Induction hob, oven, dishwasher, microwave, pots, pans, dishes, silverware, knife block
		Living room: couch, living room coffee table (IKEA), TV entertainment stand/credenza (IKEA), 
		Dining room: table, overhang light, book shelves (IKEA)
		Toilet room: toilet (no sink)
		Hallway: huge mirror, closet 
	1st floor:
		Main bedroom: small 3 drawer dresser (IKEA), wardrobe (IKEA)
		Willa's bedroom: small 3 drawer dresser (IKEA)
		Bathroom: Bathtub, sesperate shower, sink, cabinets (IKEA)
		Toilet room:toilet (no sink)
	2nd floor
		Guest bedroom: multiple drawers and wardrobes 
		Hallway: table

Any known issues (heavy grease in kitchen, paint overspray, pet hair, nicotine, mold, construction dust)?
RESPONSE: 
	Oven needs to be deep cleaned
	Dishwasher needs deep clean
	Microwave is really gross. I am considering replacing it with something else
	Couch is a used couch and needs deep cleaning
	There were no pets, but there are network cables and power cords everywhere. 


2. Surface & material specifics

What floor finishes are present on each level? (e.g., laminate, hardwood, tile, carpet, vinyl, cork).
RESPONSE: 
	Ground floor: Mostly laminate wood flooring
	1st floor: Laminate and laminate wood flooring
	2nd floor: Laminate and laminate wood flooring

Countertops & splash-backs: laminate, composite stone, natural stone, stainless steel, etc.
RESPONSE: 
	Countertops are all laminate 
	Backsplash is a mix of tile, glass, and steel

Bathroom surfaces: tile type, natural stone, acrylic bath, glass shower screen?
RESPONSE: 
	Acrylic bath and drop in shower 


3. Fixtures, fittings & extras to clean
	1. Mostly on the first floor, but there are lamps, hanging lights, and recessed lights on all floors 

Window coverings (blinds, curtains) staying in place?
RESPONSE: 
	There are a mix of very old blinds and curtains. Some of that cheap flimsy metal, some are wider white slats

Built-in wardrobes / shelving that need interior cleaning?
RESPONSE: 
	No built in wardrobes or shelving. Everything is IKEA and not very expensive. 
	
Any attic hatch or crawl-space to include?
RESPONSE: None

Garden elements: patio stones, decking, outdoor lighting, shed interior?
RESPONSE: 
	There is, but I'm not as concerned about cleaning all of that just yet. It will be it's own project



4. Water quality & allergies

Do you have hard water where limescale is a concern (typical in Leiden but varies by street)?
RESPONSE: 
	No real concerns with hard water
	
Any fragrance sensitivities or preference for eco/low-VOC products?
RESPONSE: 
	I am okay cleaning with whatever works best. Eventually, when Amelia (my wife) and Willa (my daughter) arrive they will be senstive

HEPA vacuum or air-purifier needed during clean?
RESPONSE: 
	Vacuum: I don't think it would be required. I do have a Miele vacuum (Type: HS01 Model: S370) I would eventually like to get a much better vacuum cleaner.
	Air Purifier: We don't have any yet, but it will be important to me that we get these as soon as possible.

5. Equipment already on hand

Do you already own a good vacuum, microfiber mops, buckets, extension poles, etc. in NL?
RESPONSE: 
	I gave you the details for the vacuum already. I do have a mop and bucket. I do not have an extension pole. I also have various cleaners. 

	I have these being delivered to the house tomorrow (08/05/2025)

I will upload pictures of the other cleaning products I have so you can create an inventory.

Access to an outdoor tap or indoor hot-water source for bucket fills?
RESPONSE: 
We have indoor hot water and outdoor taps availavilble 

6. Man-power & timing

Will one person tackle this sequentially, or will you have a small team (2-3 people) so I can parallelize tasks?
RESPONSE: 
	I will be by myself doing this

Desired completion window (e.g., one long day, two half-days)?
RESPONSE: 
	I would think that two and a half days would be sufficent


7. Special goals

Do you want an odor-neutralization step (ozone, enzymatic spray) even if odors aren’t obvious?
RESPONSE: 
	i do not yet, but I am open to suggestions. The bathroom with the shower in it seems to have a little bit of a smell and I think it may be due to the drain

Any pest-prevention step (insecticidal dust in wall voids, ant bait, etc.)?
RESPONSE: 
	There is dust all over the walls because they are textured and they really show dirt. We will eventually be painting them or replacing the textured walls with something else, but I want it to be as clean as possible before Amelia and Willa arrive in October. 



**Quick clarifications (text OK):**

1. _Ceiling height_ on ground/first floors? (Just rough—standard 2.4 m or higher?)
RESPONSE: standard

2. Any **window count** estimate per floor? (So I nail glass-cleaner quantity.)
RESPONSE: Several and too many to count =)
    
3. What **trash/recycling system** is on-street? (Bin bags vs. municipal wheeled bins dictates liners you’ll need.)
RESPONSE: I have not setup garbage pickup yet and I plan to do that this week. Right now I will be taking my trash to a nearby garbage collection area
