Still-open details I need before drafting your room-by-room pre-move-in deep-clean checklist

If you don’t know an answer, just say so or leave it blank; I can design the plan to cover all possibilities.

1. Current cleanliness & occupancy

Will the house be completely empty when you get access (including fridge, wardrobes, garden shed)?
RESPONSE: 

Any known issues (heavy grease in kitchen, paint overspray, pet hair, nicotine, mold, construction dust)?
RESPONSE: 


2. Surface & material specifics

What floor finishes are present on each level? (e.g., laminate, hardwood, tile, carpet, vinyl, cork).
RESPONSE: 

Countertops & splash-backs: laminate, composite stone, natural stone, stainless steel, etc.
RESPONSE: 

Bathroom surfaces: tile type, natural stone, acrylic bath, glass shower screen?
RESPONSE: 


3. Fixtures, fittings & extras to clean

Window coverings (blinds, curtains) staying in place?
RESPONSE: 

Built-in wardrobes / shelving that need interior cleaning?
RESPONSE: 

Any attic hatch or crawl-space to include?
RESPONSE: 

Garden elements: patio stones, decking, outdoor lighting, shed interior?
RESPONSE: 



4. Water quality & allergies

Do you have hard water where limescale is a concern (typical in Leiden but varies by street)?
RESPONSE: 

Any fragrance sensitivities or preference for eco/low-VOC products?
RESPONSE: 

HEPA vacuum or air-purifier needed during clean?
RESPONSE: 



5. Equipment already on hand

Do you already own a good vacuum, microfiber mops, buckets, extension poles, etc. in NL?
RESPONSE: 

Access to an outdoor tap or indoor hot-water source for bucket fills?
RESPONSE: 


6. Man-power & timing

Will one person tackle this sequentially, or will you have a small team (2-3 people) so I can parallelize tasks?
RESPONSE: 

Desired completion window (e.g., one long day, two half-days)?
RESPONSE: 



7. Special goals

Do you want an odor-neutralization step (ozone, enzymatic spray) even if odors aren’t obvious?
RESPONSE: 

Any pest-prevention step (insecticidal dust in wall voids, ant bait, etc.)?
RESPONSE: 





1. Sequencing tips (solo vs. team) and estimated person-hours.
